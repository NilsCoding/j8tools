# j8tools *by NilsCoding*This is just a simple collection - or you might call it "playground" - for classes which utilize some of the new features of Java 8, mostly related to streams.# Some examples and background informationAs you might know, Java 8 introduces the concept of Streams - in short: a source of objects, provided by a collection or a generator. Like in C#, streams in Java can be filtered and mapped, and they are only consumed if requested. Please note that if a stream was consumed, it cannot be reused and a new stream must be aquired from the source.## Example for creating a stream from a list```javaList<String> list = Arrays.asList("A", "B", "C", "D");Stream<String> stream = list.stream();```## Example for consuming a stream```java// number of elementslong count = list.stream().count();// print each elementlist.stream().forEach(System.out::println);// alternative syntax for printing each elementlist.stream().forEach(s -> System.out.println(s));// even more verbose SyntaxConsumer<String> sysOut = s -> System.out.println(s);list.stream().forEach(sysOut);```# ConsumersSimply speaking, a Consumer is the final target of elements that are provided by the stream. In the code example above "s -> System.out.println(s)" can be considered as the Consumer. And as you can also see there, it can be written as a Consumer object.So, why not have some more pre-defined consumers? These are just some examples from j8tools.## CountingConsumerCounts how many elements were consumed.```javaCountingConsumer<String> counter = new CountingConsumer<>(System.out::println);list.stream().forEach(counter);System.out.println("number of elements processed: " + counter.getCount());```## RoundRobinConsumerForwards each element to one of the given consumers, in a Round-Robin fashion.```javaRoundRobinConsumer<String> roundRobin = new RoundRobinConsumer<>(        s -> System.out.println("1: " + s),        s -> System.out.println("2: " + s));list.stream().forEach(roundRobin);```## other notable Consumers* DiscardingConsumer: Discards every element* RandomDistributionConsumer: Forwards each element to one of the given Consumers, chosen randomly* RandomlyDiscardingConsumer: Forwards the elements to the given Consumer, but randomly discards an element (around 50% are discarded)* SplittingConsumer: Forwards each element to all of the given Consumers# SupplierThe source of the stream can also be a Supplier, which is a kind of generator. It can either generate an infinite number of elements, or a limited one. Most of the Suppliers in j8tools are just wrappers around other Suppliers or produce an infinite number of elements.## NthIntegerSupplierProvides Integer values, starting with 0, increasing by 1.Two other constructors allow to specifiy a different start value and/or an (exclusive) maximum value.```javaStream<Integer> numbers = Stream.generate(new NthIntegerSupplier());// print first 10 numbers from streamnumbers.limit(10).forEach(System.out::println);```## PrimeLongSupplierProvides prime numbers. Please be aware that the bigger the numbers become, the longer it will take to provide the next prime.```javaStream<Long> primes = Stream.generate(new PrimeLongSupplier());// print first 30 prime numbers from streamprimes.limit(30).forEach(System.out::println);```## other notable Suppliers* CountingSupplier: Wraps an existing Supplier and counts how many elements have been supplied* FibonacciLongSupplier: Provides a sequence of Fibonacci numbers* ForwardingSupplier: Wraps an existing Supplier and forwards each element to a Consumer* InfiniteInstanceSupplier: Provides the given object infinitivelySome Suppliers also have copies that are implemented to work with primitive values. This is due to the different handling e.g. of Supplier<Integer> and IntSupplier in the Java Streams framework.# Copyright / Licensej8tools is licensed under the MIT License## The MIT License (MIT)Copyright (c) 2015 NilsCodingPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copyof this software and associated documentation files (the "Software"), to dealin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rightsto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sellcopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software isfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in allcopies or substantial portions of the Software.THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS ORIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
